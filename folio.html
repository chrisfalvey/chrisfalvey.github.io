    <h2>Folio</h2>
    <p>Thanks for visiting and following me on this journey.</p>
    <p>In space below I will be including demonstrations of my work. At the moment many of these will come from completed projects and sections from the full-stack development course that I am undertaking. In the future I will also include other elements that may include my prior work in media and design, and some of my teaching and learning work.</p>
