     <h2>Updates</h2>
    
    <p>Welcome to my updates page! This is where I’ll be sharing my progress, insights, and experiences as I work through my Udemy Full-Stack Development course from Dr. Angela Yu. Expect regular updates on my journey into the world of web and app development.</p>

    <p>I’ll be posting multiple times a week as I learn new skills and tackle exciting projects. Currently, I’m deep into the course, and I’m especially eager to apply what I’m learning to real-world problems and share those experiences with you.</p>

    <p>This is a big shift for me—moving from the classroom to full-time web development. While I’m proud of my leadership and achievements in education, I’m excited about the change in lifestyle and the opportunities that web development holds. I’ve always had a passion for applying technology to solve problems, from using spreadsheets for accurate student data tracking to Python scripting for engaging with web APIs. Now, I’m ready to level up my knowledge and expertise to help others.</p>

    <p>Stay tuned for more updates, and feel free to follow along on my journey as I continue to grow as a developer.</p>

    <h3>Content updates for site</h3>
    <h4>Tuesday 7 January, 2025</h4>

    <p>I have added additional contnet to each page within the site. Still text based, I am looking forward to including CSS formatting and addition visuals in th ecoming days.</p>

    <h3>Github site setup and deployed</h3>
    <h4>Monday 6 January, 2025</h4>

    <p>Today I am launching this site as a demonstration of <i>Capstone 1</i> of Dr. Angela Yu's <i>The Complete 2024 Web Development Bootcamp</i>. Demonstating an understanding of multi-page HTML websites, and a familliarity with Microsoft VS Code and Github Pages, this site is currently based around four discrete HTML files. Content has been added to the <a href="index.html">index.html</a> and <a href="updates.html">updates.html</a> files, with the <a href="contact.html">contact.html</a> and <a href="aboutme.html">aboutme.html</a> files being included as placeholders for later development.</p>
    <p>This <i>capstone</i> project demonstrates learning for the first four sections of the course. Following sections, including CSS, will shortly be implimented to this site, along with portfolio demonstrations of my work.</p>
