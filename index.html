    <p>This page is being developed as part of the <i>The Complete 2024 Web Development Bootcamp</i> course from udemy.</p>
    <p>While I have previous experience in full-stack web development, I am undertaking this course to update my skills and knowledge as I have not practiced these specfic skills since returning to the classroom teaching environment.</p>
    <p>It is my intention to complete this course, and to gain employment as a full-stck developer.</p>
    <p>I also maintain a personal website available at <a href="http://www.chrisfalvey.xyz">chrisfalvey.xyz</a>. My work here on my Github site is however a demonstration of my progress through the course. I am also aiming to utilise this space as a method of ensuring a consistent demonstration of coding practice.</p>
