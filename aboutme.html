    <h2>Passions and Interests</h2>
    <p>I have always been interested in technology. In particular, how humans interact with technology to solve problems. As a result of this, and subscribing to the Kevin Kelly view of the <i>Technium</i>, I believe that we as have and continue to live in symbiosis with the tools that's we've created.</p>
    <p>This said, I also remain healthily conflicted between the push of technology and desire for minimalism and simplicity.</p>
