    <h2>Updates</h2>
    <p>Thanks for visiting and following me on this journey.</p>
    <p>In space below I will be writing regular updates relevant to my transition into full-stack development. As this is very much a work in progress, updates to this site should be frequent and aligned to my progress through a <i>Udemy</i> course. Please check back regularly.</p>

    <h3>Folio section launched with first CSS project</h3>
    <h4>Sunday 19 January, 2025</h4>

    <p>Updating this site to include a section for a <a href="./folio.html">folio</a> that demonstrates my ongoing progress, I have setup a portfolio section and included links to the initial CSS project, completed in the full-stack development course that I am completing.</p>
    <p>As I complete more and more projects, I will include demonstrations of them in the folio section. Additionally, at a later date, I might include desondatrations of my work from both media, and teching and learning.</p>

    <h3>Github site setup and deployed</h3>
    <h4>Monday 6 January, 2025</h4>

    <p>Today I am launching this site as a demonstration of <i>Capstone 1</i> of Dr. Angela Yu's <i>The Complete 2024 Web Development Bootcamp</i>. Demonstating an understanding of multi-page HTML websites, and a familliarity with Microsoft VS Code and Github Pages, this site is currently based around four discrete HTML files. Content has been added to the <a href="index.html">index.html</a> and <a href="updates.html">updates.html</a> files, with the <a href="contact.html">contact.html</a> and <a href="aboutme.html">aboutme.html</a> files being included as placeholders for later development.</p>
    <p>This <i>capstone</i> project demonstrates learning for the first four sections of the course. Following sections, including CSS, will shortly be implimented to this site, along with portfolio demonstrations of my work.</p>
