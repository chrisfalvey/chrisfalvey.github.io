    <p>This page is being developed as part of the <i>The Complete 2024 Web Development Bootcamp</i> course from udemy.</p>
    <p>While I have previous experience in full-stack web development, I am undertaking this course to update my skills and knowledge as I have not practiced these specfic skills since returning to the classroom teaching environment.</p>
    <p>It is my intention to complete this course, and to gain employment as a full-stck developer.</p>
    <p>I also maintain a personal website available at <a href="http://www.chrisfalvey.xyz">chrisfalvey.xyz</a>. My work here on my Github site is however a demonstration of my progress through the course. I am also aiming to utilise this space as a method of ensuring a consistent demonstration of coding practice.</p>

    <h2>Summary</h2>

    <p>Hello! My name is Chris, and I’m currently a teacher of Applied Learning (VCE VM) in Victoria, Australia. My career has spanned various fields, from media and design to education. Today, I’m in the midst of transitioning into a full-stack web and app development role, building on my lifelong passion for programming.</p>

    <p>I have always been fascinated by programming, starting with the GW Basic user’s manual for a Canon Athena XT Clone back in the 1980s. This early introduction ignited a love for technology that has stayed with me throughout my career. While I currently teach, I am diving deep into web development and am particularly fond of Python for its simplicity, utility, and versatility.</p>

    <p>As I build my skills in full-stack development, I apply my core values of simplicity and minimalism to everything I do. Whether it’s creating layouts, coding solutions, or communicating ideas, I prioritize functionality and aesthetics. I strongly believe that great design is not just about how something looks, but how it works.</p>

    <p>Beyond my professional work, I’m an avid traveler and retro gaming enthusiast. I love exploring new places, learning about different cultures, and seeking inspiration from the past. My passion for retro games, especially 80s and 90s adventure games, also gives me a unique perspective on design and problem-solving.</p>

    <p>I’m excited about the future and looking forward to the challenges and opportunities ahead in the world of web and app development!</p>
